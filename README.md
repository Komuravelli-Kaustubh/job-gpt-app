JobGPT 🧑‍💻
JobGPT is an AI-powered job search assistant built with Streamlit.
It understands natural language queries and finds jobs from multiple sources like Careerjet, Jooble, and Web3 Career APIs.
Groq's LLM is used to intelligently parse user queries and extract job search parameters like role, location, remote, and recency.

The app aggregates results, filters duplicates, and shows you the best matching job listings with easy apply links — all from a simple chat-like interface.
